### About
In Data Science, Time Series Analysis is quite important. Many businesses often deal with large amounts of transactional data that can be used to forecast or predict results. In this dataset, I will explore the data and answer key questions, which ultimately may be able to help reduce traffic accidents. I am looking to sharpen my Time Series Analysis, and use both statistical and machine learning models to predict traffic accidents in the future.

### Current Progress
I am currently answering various questions that can assist with EDA. I will continue to analyze the data and pose new questions that will contribute to the final goal of predicting accidents in 2021.

### Models Used
[FBProphet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)

[ARIMA](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.arima_model.ARIMA.html)

### Next Steps
Here are the steps that I am taking in this project to ensure success.

1. Similar to other projects, further explore to further understand the data
2. Break the columns into smaller parts and analyse feature importance
3. Create advanced data visualizations to understand features more importantly
4. Strengthen time series analysis and use models to predict
